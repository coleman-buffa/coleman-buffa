### Hi there!

My name is Coleman Buffa and I am a full stack developer who rececently completed training at the UC Berkeley Extension Code Camp. Learning so many new skills in a short time was a great experience and I look forward to continuing my journey.

Like many developers I learn best when I build something. Everytime I do I aim to have a blend of something familiar, a skill that needs improving, and a concept that is entirely new. This makes projects do-able but challenging so I can improve.

Topics I am exploring:
* Expanding my Full Stack Development Skills
* Containers
* Hosting containers on a raspberry pi
* CI/CD

I am currently seeking full time employment!
