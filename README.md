### Hi there!

My name is Coleman Buffa and I am a developer (among many things). I enjoy building a variety of projects which aim to grow my skills so I can take on increasingly ambitious endeavors.

Topics I am exploring:
* Expanding my Full Stack development skills
* Experiments in electronics using Arduino Uno Kits
