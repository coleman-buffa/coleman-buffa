### Hi there!

My name is Coleman Buffa and I am a full stack developer currently training at the UC Berkeley Extension program. Learning so many new skills in a short time is a great experience and I look forward to finding a job as a developer in the near future.

Like many developers I learn best when I build something. Everytime I build something I aim to have a blend of something familiar, a skill that needs improving, and a concept that is entirely new. This makes projects do-able but challenging so I can improve.
