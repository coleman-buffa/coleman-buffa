### Hi there!

My name is Coleman Buffa and I am a full stack developer. evelopers I learn best when I build something. Everytime I do, I aim to have a blend of something familiar, a skill that needs improving, and a concept that is entirely new. This makes projects do-able but challenging so I can improve.

Topics I am exploring:
* Expanding my Full Stack Development Skills
* Container hosting and orchestration on a Raspberry Pi 4
* Experiments with an [Arduino Kit](https://www.elegoo.com/products/elegoo-uno-project-super-starter-kit) 

I am currently seeking full time employment!
